                <img src="../public/images/animal1.JPG" alt="black grouper"/>
                <p>Black grouper are born female, but some transform into 
                    males when they are large enough. These fish can live 
                    for more than 30 years, 
                    though most are caught before reaching that age.

                <h3>Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin</h3>
                <img src="../public/images/animal2.JPG" alt="Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin"/>
                <p>Atlantic bottlenose dolphins are smart, social animals,
                    called "bottlenose" because of their short, stubby 
                    rostrums, or snouts. A bottlenose dolphin's back is a 
                    nlight to slate gray color, which fades to a pale gray 
                    or pink belly. This species' dorsal fin is tall and 
                    curves backward. The fluke, or tail fin, is curved with 
                    a deep notch in the middle, and their pectoral, or side, 
                    fins are pointed.

                <img src="../public/images/animal3.JPG" alt="Atlantic Bay Nettle"/>
                <p>The Atlantic bay nettle has two color varieties; 
                    in the upper Chesapeake Bay, the white variety is most prevalent, and closer to the Atlantic Ocean, this jelly can have a white, red or brown coloration. Nettles populate the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries primarily from July through September, 
                    though some individuals can be present into November.

                <img src="../public/images/animal4.JPG" alt="Harlequin Tuskfish"/>
                <p>The stunning harlequin tuskfish usually has eight pairs 
                    of alternating orange, blue, and white bands on its 
                    body and prominent sharp, blue teeth. This species 
                    inhabits coral reefs and has been found as deep as 105 
                    feet. The harlequin tuskfish is a solitary animal, 
                    but it can be aggressive and territorial at times.

                <img src="../public/images/animal5.JPG" alt="Green Sea Turtle"/>
                <p>The reticulated whiptail ray has a light brown body 
                    with dark brown spots and a solid white underside. 
                    Its snout is pointed, and its tail can reach three 
                    times the length of its body. 
                    The tail usually has one barb on it.

                <h3>Reticulated Whiptail Ray</h3>
                <img src="../public/images/animal6.JPG" alt="Reticulated Whiptail Ray"/>
                <p>The reticulate whipray is also called the leopard ray, 
                    honeycomb stingray, and reticulate whiptail ray. It is one of about 20 ray 
                    species in which the common name includes whipray. This ray's dorsal side is 
                    covered in an intricate pattern of conspicuous dark spots from which it gets the 
                    reticulate part of its common name. It inhabits tropical and 
                    subtropical waters in sandy areas of coral reefs and in lagoons and estuaries.

                <h3>Giant Waxy Tree Frog</h3>
                <img src="../public/images/animal7.jpg" alt="Waxy Tree Frog">
                <p>These frogs inhabit drier parts of treetops, where they prevent themselves 
                    from drying out by wiping wax, produced by special skin glands, over their bodies. 
                    Because of this, they are sometimes called waxy frogs. 
                    Eggs are laid on large leaves overhanging the water. 
                    As the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water to begin development.</p>

                <img src="../public/images/animal8.jpg" alt="Discus Fish">
                <p>Nicknamed the “pompadour fish” for their distinctive look, 
                    discus have a round, flat body similar in shape to a disk. 
                    They vary in color, donning hues of green, red, brown and blue 
                    and have dark vertical stripes. These stripes serve a dual purpose: 
                    to aid in communication within a school of discus and to camouflage 
                    the fish from predators.</p>

                <h3>Barramundi</h3>
                <img src="../public/images/animal 9.jpg" alt="Barramundi Fish">
                <p>The barramundi is a large, silver fish that changes sex as it grows. 
                    Once the fish reaches about 20 inches in length, it transitions from male to female.
                    Barramundis are born in estuaries. They move temporarily to swamps, then to the mouths 
                    and upper regions of rivers until full grown. 
                    The fish spend the remainder of their lives in rivers before 
                    returning to estuaries to spawn.</p>
