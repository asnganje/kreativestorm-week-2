                <img src="../public/images/animal1.JPG" alt="black grouper"/>
                <p>Black grouper are born female, but some transform into 
                    males when they are large enough. These fish can live 
                    for more than 30 years, 
                    though most are caught before reaching that age.

                <h3>Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin</h3>
                <img src="../public/images/animal2.JPG" alt="Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin"/>
                <p>Atlantic bottlenose dolphins are smart, social animals,
                    called "bottlenose" because of their short, stubby 
                    rostrums, or snouts. A bottlenose dolphin's back is a 
                    nlight to slate gray color, which fades to a pale gray 
                    or pink belly. This species' dorsal fin is tall and 
                    curves backward. The fluke, or tail fin, is curved with 
                    a deep notch in the middle, and their pectoral, or side, 
                    fins are pointed.

                <h3>Atlantic Bay Nettle</h3>
                <img src="../public/images/animal3.JPG" alt="Atlantic Bay Nettle"/>
                <p>The Atlantic bay nettle has two color varieties; 
                    in the upper Chesapeake Bay, the white variety is most prevalent, and closer to the Atlantic Ocean, this jelly can have a white, red or brown coloration. Nettles populate the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries primarily from July through September, 
                    though some individuals can be present into November.

                <img src="../public/images/animal4.JPG" alt="Harlequin Tuskfish"/>
                <p>The stunning harlequin tuskfish usually has eight pairs 
                    of alternating orange, blue, and white bands on its 
                    body and prominent sharp, blue teeth. This species 
                    inhabits coral reefs and has been found as deep as 105 
                    feet. The harlequin tuskfish is a solitary animal, 
                    but it can be aggressive and territorial at times.

                <p>The reticulated whiptail ray has a light brown body 
                    with dark brown spots and a solid white underside. 
                    Its snout is pointed, and its tail can reach three 
                    times the length of its body. 
                    The tail usually has one barb on it.
